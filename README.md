Python's Tkinter module was used to create a straightforward graphical user interface (GUI) for the game Tic-Tac-Toe. Two players can alternately mark "X" and "O" on a 3x3 board in this game. 
When the board is full, the game automatically identifies the winner, highlights the winning combination, and declares a tie.
